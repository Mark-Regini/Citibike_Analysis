For the purpose of this task, I will consider anything above 0.05 a weak relationship to provide me with variables to complete the rest of the task. The relationships are defined below:\n",
    "#### - This correlation would be defined as weak and positive. This simply tells us that the locations occur within a very small portion of the globe: New York City. Longitude and latitude will clearly have a commonality and thus a correlation: they are locations within a city, a small area in the scope of the world and would likely be close to one another.\n",

One thing we will need to look into are the birth years; I see a lot of plots of those born in the 1900s. I also see that those that put the 1900s year in their profile also are listed as undefined gender, which tells me they simply did not fill out the customer profile. Logic tells me that this is a default number given in the app, but I would need to contact stakeholders to make sure this is accurate. Later on, I would like to look at the trip duration and start hour of the trips in relation to gender and whether they are a subscriber or not, as this could give us valuable insight on the customer base and how to better serve them."
