# Citibike_Analysis
A deep-dive into customer usage data from NYC Citibike

## Objective
Using Python, I gathered usage data collected by customer trips with NYC Citibike in 2013 and performed linear regression and predictive model analysis to determine unseen correlations between variables. This culminated in a Tableau dashboard demonstrating any findings. NOTE: Not all analysis is presented within the Tableau presentation; this can be found within the project folders provided.

## Data
The following data was used in this analysis:
- Start station longitude and latitude coordinates
- Start hour of the trip
- Customer age
- Customer gender

## Tools
The coding language used in this analysis was Python, using Jupyter notebooks. The following libraries were used in the analysis:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- OS
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Statsmodels.api
